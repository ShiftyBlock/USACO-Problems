README
Some material has been moved to the USACO Guide.

Notes
I am currently not updating the following pages:

README's for most implementations
tables and solutions for non-platinum USACO contests
Since I frequently move stuff around, some text may refer to files which no longer exist. If you would like to contribute, provide feedback, or encourage me to update something, i will do it. If you have a question, please read the entirety of "Resources" -> "Questions.md" first.
